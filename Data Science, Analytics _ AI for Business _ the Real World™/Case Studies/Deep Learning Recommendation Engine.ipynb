Build the Entity embedding Neural Network & Train Model\n","\n","With our dataset and a supervised machine learning task, we're almost there. The next step is the most technically complicated but thankfully fairly simple with Keras. We are going to construct the neural network that learns the entity embeddings. \n","\n","The input to this network is the (movie, link) (either positive or negative) as integers, and the output will be a prediction of whether or not the link was present in the book article. However, we're not actually interested in the prediction except as the device used to train the network by comparison to the label. What we are after is at the heart of the network: **the embedding layers**, one for the movie and one for the link each of which maps the input entity to a 50 dimensional vector. The layers of our network are as follows:\n","\n","1. Input: parallel inputs for the movie and link\n","2. Embedding: parallel embeddings for the movie and link\n","3. Dot: computes the dot product between the embeddings to merge them together\n","4. Reshape: utility layer needed to correct the shape of the dot product\n","5. [Optional] Dense: fully connected layer with sigmoid activation to generate output for classification\n","\n","After converting the inputs to an embedding, we need a way to combine the embeddings into a single number. For this we can use the dot product which does element-wise multiplication of numbers in the vectors and then sums the result to a single number. This raw number (after reshaping) is then the ouput of the model for the case of regression. In regression, our labels are either -1 or 1, and so the model loss function will be mean squared error in order to minimize the distance between the prediction and the output. Using the dot product with normalization means that the `Dot` layer is finding the cosine similarity between the embedding for the movie and the link. Using this method for combining the embeddings means we are trying to make the network learn similar embeddings for movies that link to similar pages. \n","\n","### Classification vs Regression\n","\n","For classification, we add an extra fully connected `Dense` layer with a `sigmoid` activation to squash the outputs between 0 and 1 because the labels are either 0 or 1. The loss function for classification is `binary_crossentropy` which measures the [error of the neural network predictions in a binary classification problem](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/loss_functions.html), and is a measure of the similarity between two distributions. We can train with either classification or regression, and in practice, I found that both approaches produced similar embeddings. I'm not sure about the technical merits of these methods, and I'd be interested to hear if one is better than the other. \n","\n","The optimizer - the algorithm used to update the parameters (also called weights) of the neural network after calculating the gradients through backpropagation - is Adam in both cases ([Adam is a modification to Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/)). We use the default parameters for this optimizer. The nice thing about modern neural network frameworks is we don't have to worry about backpropagation or updating the model parameters because that is done for us. It's nice to have an idea of what is occuring behind the scenes, but it's not entirely necessary to use a neural network effectively.
